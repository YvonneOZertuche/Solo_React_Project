# Solo_React_Project: Let's Talk

A sudo social media app (similar to Facebook and/or Twitter) which allows for a user to sign-up and add personal posts.  

The app allows a new user to register and then add, edit and delete posts.  The app allows the user to be able to view a list of their posts or an individual post. As well as 'follow' other users.

The app utilizes React, Bootstrap, Gravatar & MongoDB.
