# Solo_React_Project: Let's Talk

A sudo social media app (similar to Facebook and/or Twitter) which allows for a user to sign-up and add personal posts.  

The app allows a new user to register and then add, edit and delete posts.  The app allows the user to be able to view a list of their posts
or an individual post.

The app is connected to MongoDB, which is where the data is stored and collected.  

The project was made with ReactJS.
